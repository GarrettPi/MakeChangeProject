# Make Change

### Overview

MakeChange is a fun little program with a simple goal: calculate change to dispense in a transaction and then list the largest possible denominations to make correct change.  I've integrated loops into the code to allow the user to make the correct change as many times as they'd like.

### How to Use

Upon running the program, the user will be guided through a few simple text prompts to enter the transaction amount and then the amount of money tendered.  MakeChange will make the appropriate calculations and display the correct the change for the user to dispense back to the customer.  MakeChange will then prompt the user to indicate whether or not they wish to proceed with an additional change calculation.  The user can choose to repeat the process to their heart's desire or they can opt out and the program will terminate.
